Attentive Model: Replication of [Teaching machine to read and comprehend](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340) is done. The model can overfit trainingset of 3000 samples. I am running test on larger data. 
    
Update: currently achieved 50% accuracy on training and dev dataset.

My work is partly based on carpedm20's [Code](https://github.com/carpedm20/attentive-reader-tensorflow).

Other Model: in construction
